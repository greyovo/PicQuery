> üçé For iOS users, please refer to _[Queryable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/queryable-find-photo-by-text/id1661598353)_ ([Code](https://github.com/mazzzystar/Queryable)), the inspiration behind this application, developed by [@mazzzystar](https://github.com/mazzzystar/Queryable).

## Implementation

> Thanks to [@mazzzystar](https://github.com/mazzzystar) and [@Young-Flash](https://github.com/Young-Flash) for their assistance during the development. The discussion can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mazzzystar/Queryable/issues/12).

_PicQuery_ is powered by OpenAI's [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).

First, the images to be searched are encoded into vectors using an image encoder and stored in a database. The text provided by the user during the search is also encoded into a vector. The encoded text vector is then compared with the indexed image vectors to calculate the similarity. The top K images with the highest similarity scores are selected as the query results.

## Build & Run

To build this project, you need to obtain a quantized CLIP model.


- `vision_model.ort`
- `text_model.ort`

> download them from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HgGDfsHHIlDK_Fx0Spnujxt51SgguNCq?usp=drive_link).

Put them into `app\src\main\assets` and you're ready to go.
